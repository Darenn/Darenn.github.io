<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sid Meier's most famous game is one of my favorite strategy game; <em>Civilization</em>.</p>
<p>In his memoir, he talks about the key moments of his career and shares funny and interesting anecdotes that makes it a real pleasure to read.</p>
<p>As you can guess, there are also a lot of <strong>Game Development tips and lessons</strong> throughout the book, which I'm gonna make sure you can get in this article.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/articles/JustOneMoreTurn/sidmeierbook.jpg" alt="Photo of Sid Meier's Memoir book front cover"></p>
<p>If you need more details, or just want to enjoy a nice story, I invite you to get the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XWfeOk" title="Link to the Sid Meier's Memoir">book</a>.</p>
<h4>Sid's long career (in very short).</h4>
<p>Sid started as an engineer in accounting programming. During a trip to Las Vegas, he associated with Bill Stealy to create a video game studio, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse">MicroProse</a> and started creating flight simulation games on his free time.</p>
<p>He progressively worked more and more at MicroProse, only leaving his first job when money was not a problem anymore. There's something I was really surprised with; they were making the copy themselves on floppy disks and selling them directly to the small stores across the country, one by one.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x0/5/4/03ea17029c2cbfaa416fd9a5e3bdde826f6fe1fa5bd20cb8590abe5a4fff85/s-l400.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ebayimg.com%2Fimages%2Fg%2FI-AAAOSw-OVf94TI%2Fs-l400.jpg&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=0" alt="Photo of civilization floppy disks" title="Photo of civilization floppy disks"></p>
<p>In the beginning Sid was doing everything; visuals, programming, sound and music, game design. On later games, they hired artists and sound designers so that he could focus on programming and game design.</p>
<p>At some point they sold the company and both Bill and Sid quit. Soon after that, Sid created his game studio, Firaxis, where he still works.</p>
<h3>Game Design Tips</h3>
<h4>Keep the player focus on what's yet to come.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge portion of Civilization happens in this nebulous &quot;after that&quot; realm, stacking potential paths on top of actual.
A bad game strands you in the past while a mediocre one keeps you in the present. But a really good game keeps you focused on what's yet to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like cliffhangers in series or movies, you need to tease the player enough so that he wants to see the next turn/level/wave/corner. Reward him for getting there, but focus your attention on the next thing to do.</p>
<p>There's a popular quote among <em>Civilization</em>'s players :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just one more turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Losing comes later, after the rewards have been established.</h4>
<p>In 1985, he released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYJCZPT68Bs"><em>Silent Service</em></a>, a strategy naval war game. He demonstrated it to a major buyer, who was crushed by the AI really quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are defeated during a demo, everyone in the room feels the letdown, and it’s very hard to erase that first impression of disappointment.</p>
<p>Of course the game shouldn't always be easy, but the time for losing comes later, after the rewards have been firmly established. In those first crucial minutes, the player absolutely must win, whether it’s a kid alone on his computer or a gaggle of salespeople around a conference table.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Interesting Decisions are all about investment.</h4>
<p>Sid is very well known for the following quote :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game is a series of interesting decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what we actually like are the interesting decisions, that you already take in everyday life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] games weren't the defining theme of my childhood after all. Rather, it was their precursor: the interesting decision. I've always been fascinated by every type of interesting decision, and game just happens to be a well-curated series of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what's an interesting decision then ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting decisions are not about the specifics of what you let the player choose between, but whether the investment feels both personal and significant to the outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A decision needs to have some kind of <strong>impact</strong> (or at least the player should believe it has). The player needs to have some <strong>investment</strong> in the choice and feel like its his <strong>personal</strong> choice.</p>
<h4>A Game Designer does not create the Fun, he Finds it.</h4>
<p>We should have some knowledge about human psychology (humanity's flaws) and use this knowledge to find what makes our gameplay experience fun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing I like about Mel Brooks, and comedians in general, is that they're actually very analytical. To dig down and figure out what's funny about a particular phrase or story is not so different from isolating what makes a gameplay experience compelling.</p>
<p>Both are trying to engage the audience with a sharpened version of reality, and both require an <strong>appreciation for humanity's flaws</strong> in order to know where the hook fits best.</p>
<p>Try to get the habit of analyzing how things work, examine their effect on people and find out what is really compelling.</p>
<p>Once you have isolated all of the interesting part of any decision, then you’re ready to build an interactive experience that feels new but familiar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, what makes the battle system in Civilization so compelling ?</p>
<p>The system is partly random, you can estimate the outcome, but you can't be sure of it. When launching a battle, you see the soldiers fighting but have to wait a few seconds to see the final result. Chances of winning are faked. If you're told you have 50% chance of winning, then the game will let you win 1/2 battles. If you have 90% of winning, you will loose very rarely.</p>
<p>We know human love surprises, it's a very strong feeling. And the effect is amplified by the waiting of the result. But they don't like unfairness, loosing 2 fights in a row with 50% chance of winning seems unfair to a human.</p>
<p>We can say the system is fun because :</p>
<ol>
<li>The player can estimate accurately the outcome and make the meaningful choice to fight (complete randomness is not an interesting choice).</li>
<li>The pseudo randomness adds an element of surprise to the outcome.</li>
<li>The player has to wait for the result, creating some tasty suspense.</li>
<li>The battle system seems fair.</li>
</ol>
<h4>No wrong answers, and more than one right answer, but not too many.</h4>
<p>While working on <em>Sid Meier Pirates</em>, he realized one of the problems of textual adventure games is that for a given puzzle, there is only one solution. For example, to open a door with a key, you have one good answer <em>&quot;Unlock door with key&quot;</em> and a lot of wrong answers <em>&quot;Open door with key&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;Use key to open door&quot;</em>, etc...</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.qwant.com/thumbr/700x0/b/c/9446d630b882042bc4bb3dd680cd3566e5313363d551b40137021355b13c2c/Colossal-Cave-Adventure.png?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.raspberrypi.org%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2FColossal-Cave-Adventure.png&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=1" alt="Handheld text-based adventure gaming with Quest Smith ..."></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our brains'executive function, or decision-making capability, tires out over time. [...] the importance of the task has no bearing on your exhaustion. Insignificant decisions take just as much brain power as interesting ones, but without any of the satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18444745/">scientific article</a> seems to confirm this concept. It is called <strong>Decision Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] We want to try everything, which leads to frustration when we can't. We don't ever want to feel like we've missed out on something good.[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In nowadays AAA, open world with endless places to be, dungeons to explore, side quests to complete, collectibles to get... endless choices. I observed that it's common practice to quit or ignore all side content and just focus on the <em>&quot;main path&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x380/e/1/ef051b11245e65625ba4b2bd1d01c3e3c7d301e1349e60c3095ad4bf00fb4c/wildlands-interactivemap2.jpg?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghostrecon.net%2Fghost-recon%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F06%2Fwildlands-interactivemap2.jpg&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=1" alt="60 Million Pixel Interactive Wildlands Map - Ghost Recon Net"></p>
<p>We need to control how much content is available at all times and guide the player. It's nice to have a lot of content and let the player choose his own way. It's not to burden the player with endless small choices to make each time he's looking at the map for his next move, even more in games that are more about action than mental skills.</p>
<h4>Don't forget to design what happens in the head of the player.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Another more general concept that I took from Seven Cities of Gold was that the anticipation of each new story line was at least as important as the story itself.
Dan didn't just design the game you could see and play, he also designed parts of the game that would take place entirely in your head.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Always give the player a fighting chance.</h4>
<p>To continue about these floods in Railroad Tycoon, he agreed it was really unfair and not fun for the player.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sudden reversal of fortune is only exciting or dramatic when it happens to someone else. When it happens to you, it's just a bummer. The key difference between a gameplay challenge and a betrayal, I realized, was whether the player has a fighting chance to avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To resolve the problem, he added two types of bridges :</p>
<ul>
<li>A wooden bridge, cheap, fast to build but with high chance of getting flood.</li>
<li>A Stone bridge, expansive, long to build, but impervious to flood.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way the player has control over the risk and the flood actually became a source of genuine reward.</p>
<h4>Simple plus simple equals complex.</h4>
<p>Don't try to design a very complex system from the start. It's way better to design small and simple systems that will interact in a complex and interesting manner. You can think of the simple rock-paper-scissors design that is used in a lot of games to keep a certain balance while giving you choices.</p>
<h4>Avoid brilliant and effective AI.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Highly realistic AI gets accused of cheating even more often than its dishonest brethren, because on some level, all players are unnerved by the idea that a computer could outsmart them.</p>
<p><strong>Part of the fun is learning the patterns of the AI and successfully predicting them</strong>,
and when computer don't act like computers, the only psychologically safe assumption is that they must have accessed information they shouldn't have.</p>
<p>AI isn't allowed to gamble, or behave randomly, or basis--not because we can't program it, but because experience tells us that players will get frustrated and quit.</p>
<p>[...] Thus, from the designer's perspective, brilliant AI is usually not our highest priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's mostly true when you're playing against AI, we need a fun AI, not a clever AI. But I can think of two examples where we should try to have brilliant AI.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>To scare the player</strong> - In <em>Alien Isolation</em> the player tries to survive and progress in the story while being tracked by an Alien. The &quot;brilliant&quot; AI that was created was acclaimed. It serves the purpose of this horror game. A clever AI is scary because of this unpredictability that is usually not fun when fighting against it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To help the player</strong> - When you're teaming up with AI, let's say in competitive games likes Overwatch, League Of Legends, etc... I think it's nice to have a pretty good AI to play with. At least to compensate player leaving the game early for example.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Games do not need to be realistic.</h4>
<p>One of his first game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5NhhmnwBU"><em>Formula 1</em></a>, was fundamentally based on reality like many other of his games later. Even in these kind of games, we don’t need a real driver with a backstory. What games need is :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A combination of emotional and psychological hooks that make you believe, however fleetingly, that you yourself are the driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The most elementary, defining feature of gaming is its interactivity</h4>
<p>In a &quot;Dinosaur RTS game&quot; that he never released, he removed all the micro management actions, letting the AI do most of the &quot;boring&quot; stuff. The problem is that the player did not have anything interesting to do anymore.</p>
<p>Be sure to focus on what your player is doing in your game, and don't fall into the trap of removing too much control from him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players may not be rewarded for every choice, but the control over the outcome must be primarily in their hands,
otherwise they're just watching a movie that demands occasional button jabs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When should you use Real-time versus Turn-based ?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When the clock keeps running and everyone can play at once, there is an immediate increase in excitement. Quick thinking is rewarded over precision, and those with short attention span finally get their day in the sun.
But while the payoff is instant and ongoing, the ratcheting intensity can easily overflow into confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>Turn-based gaming, on the other hand, is slow and methodical, and any excitement felt in the beginning is anticipatory at best. The comparative lack of intensity can risk sinking into boredom, but by the end, the payoff is usually bigger, because you've invested more time and personal choice into the outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's summarize the characteristics of both designs :</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Game Speed</th>
<th>Excitement</th>
<th>Brain</th>
<th>Intensity</th>
<th>Payoff on choice</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Real-Time</td>
<td>Immediate</td>
<td>Quick Thinking</td>
<td>High, can be overflow or confused</td>
<td>Small, instant and ongoing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Turn-Based</td>
<td>Anticipatory</td>
<td>Slow and Methodical</td>
<td>Low, can be bored</td>
<td>Big, more and personal choice into the outcome</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now think about your game, and choose a design depending of the characteristics you want.</p>
<h4>Be gentle with player ego.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In our line of work everything must be in service to fun, and it happens that learning history often is fun. But sometimes, it's also super depressing.</p>
<p>We have to offer a moral clarity to our players and eliminate the painful quandaries, because unlike other forms of storytelling, they are personnaly standing in for our main character.</p>
<p>Their ego is on the line, and we have to be gentle with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm reading that he thinks the player should feel like he is playing the good guy.</p>
<p>A lot of games have shown us that this is not the case, players like to play bad guys. On the other hand, you really have to keep in mind that ego issue. It's probably not fun to play a character that's being ridiculed or that doesn't match your values.</p>
<h4>Be Reductive in a Balanced and Polite way.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[About historical figures and event being caricatured in Civ] All games are inherently reductive. But we strive to be reductive in a balanced and polite way, and always with the goal of improving the overall experience for the player.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Civilization</em>, each civ has it's own unique buildings, units and perks. For example in Civ 6, the Norway has bonuses for naval units, naval raids and pillages.</p>
<p>Imagine the number of unique perks they should have created to have a &quot;truthful&quot; representation of Norway. They chose the best ones for a good game experience (it makes the pillaging mechanic way more interesting), based on historical facts.</p>
<p>Moreover you are not playing the Norway nation, but the leader Harald Hardrada of Norway, a subtle but important distinction to avoid some backlash like &quot;Your game is saying that Norway are savage pillagers&quot;.</p>
<p>It's delicate to craft art about historical events. Someone could still argue that the reign of Harald was not only about pillaging and that the game is leading the player to believe it is by omitting all the other stuff. The more famous your game is, the more important it is to manage that. At Ubisoft we have entire teams working on this specific subject, and we still have problems (NPCs wearing the wrong type of shields for example).</p>
<p>Let's make a list of thing to do when dealing with historical figures and events in a historically accurate game :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always use historical facts, not prejudices</strong> - Lot of pillages and raids were effectively done under Harald.</li>
<li><strong>Stay neutral</strong> - Nothing tells you that Norway are savages because of the raids.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid targeting a large group of people, be more specific</strong> - The game talks about the potential &quot;Norway of Harald&quot;, not the actual Norway.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Game Development Tips</h3>
<h4>Not every culture view games the same way.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] not every culture viewed games the same way, and that there was definitely such a thing as an American game.
What would a truly international game look like, I wondered, with no cultural bias, and universal appeal ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with every piece of art, each culture sees games differently, and as a consequence games from different culture will be very different.</p>
<p>If you target a specific culture it might be a good idea to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I don't think it's important to have a truly international game (even if still interesting from a design point of view). You should create games the way you see them trough your own culture and personal experience.</p>
<p>It's always refreshing to play games from different culture (compare the Street of Rage with Aurion : Legacy of the kori idan, the first professional game of Central Africa that I discovered during indiecade).</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.qwant.com/thumbr/0x0/0/0/edcdc0ad64bf5501872ef84a7493d42f372c54f6bea82634b77bea3905cfdb/Aurion-1.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Foperationrainfall.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2FAurion-1.jpg&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=1" alt="REVIEW: Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan - Page 2 of 2 ..."></p>
<p><img src="https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x380/7/d/8fded6e25caf6f78f17c1bbbc2084609758761af6f56bbbe59a4084c477af5/Streets-of-Rage-4-3.png?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamesn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F09%2FStreets-of-Rage-4-3.png&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=1" alt="Streets of Rage 4 won’t rely on its past to knock you out ..."></p>
<h4>Implement and try instead of pondering for hours.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] I don't let the possibility of mistakes hold me back. I won't ponder for hours whether a feature would be a good idea, I just throw it in the game and find out for sure. If it's clunky, I cut it back out again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will depend of your skill in programming, and the scope of the design you're thinking about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it really interesting ?</li>
<li>Is it mandatory for the game to work ?</li>
<li>Can I implement it quickly ?</li>
</ul>
<p>But in any case, don't loose too much time trying to figure out if it will work out. Playing is the best way to know. You should not be afraid to make mistakes.</p>
<h4>One good game is better than two great games.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Deciding what doesn't go into the game is sometimes more important than deciding what does.
One good game is better than two great games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's better to make one good game than making two great games into one. You will be making several games, avoid using all of your ideas into one if it seems like it would be better in another game.</p>
<h4>The rule of third.</h4>
<p>Civ designers traditionally follow a rule of thirds. One third of the previous version stays in place, one third is updated, and one third is completely new.</p>
<p>At Ubisoft, it's more like 90% reused or updated and 10% new.</p>
<h4>When balancing a value, double it, or cut it in half.</h4>
<p>Say you're trying to find the perfect movement speed in your FPS game. Instead of adjusting it by small amounts, directly double it or cut it, and observe the result. If it's way too slow, just double the speed again and repeat the process.</p>
<p>This method is actually inspired by a the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search algorithm</a>.</p>
<h4>Make sure the player is the one having fun.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The game isn't supposed to be about us. The player must be the star, and the designer has to be as invisible as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bekpo1o6rh4"><em>Sid Meier Railroad Tycoon</em></a>, Sid really wanted to add floods that destroy bridges. His colleague Bruce, found it very unfair. Sid insisted, but realized it was <strong>something fun to create</strong> for him, <strong>not something fun to play</strong> for the player.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it's a trap we can easily fall into. Stay in control and keep the ability to judge if it really has its place into your game or if it's just something you wanted to try.</p>
<h4>Seek joy elsewhere, because you never know where inspiration will strike.</h4>
<p>As designers, part of our job is very rigorous and analytical. But the other part is based on creativity, and creativity is fed by our everyday experiences.</p>
<p>One of the first game ever created was based on tennis, and I bet the designer did love playing tennis.</p>
<p>Of course you can get inspired by games, but you need to avoid serving the same plate every time and bring about your own unique designs. You have to make sure you continue to read, learn, and seek joy elsewhere because you never know where inspiration will strike.</p>
<h4>See technology in terms of progress, rather than limitations.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I generally saw technology in terms of progress, rather than limitations, and lived in a nearly perpetual state of excitement over what we could accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm wondering if it's still true nowadays, seems like there is no limits anymore unless you're talking about realism and size. There is a lot of new technology that did not yet have been massively used in video games and that have a huge impact on the design of games. Of course it can be because of price and comfort (VR) but just look at games like Pokemon Go, a huge hit that used Augmented Reality technology, you don't see that in every mobile game.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/474x842/e/d/067595d8ef0202d6697c949f11dd98a9c7413bfbe503cdca7f014d1daaff65/th.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.2WGpqiE4iwl4FshNWLzNVwHaNK%26pid%3DApi&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=0" alt="pokemon-go-.jpg"></p>
<p>I think a lot of developers are cornered into what games were and are, and are not really into transforming the media. I admit that I still want to make games played with a pad, keyboard sometimes, rarely VR, and never about other technology unless it's for a small project. It's not a bad thing to keep doing what you love (you can look at all the games that are still released on retro consoles) but <strong>let's keep updated about new technologies</strong> and think about what we can do with all this new stuff.</p>
<h3>Teamwork Tips</h3>
<h4>Feedback is fact.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Feedback is fact insofar as it reveals how our game makes people feel, but after that, it's our job to come up with the right solution to that problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My take on this : <strong>Feedback is not a debate</strong>.</p>
<p>When receiving feedback you disagree with, thank them without trying to find excuses or explain yourself. Ask questions if you need and find the source of the problem. If it is actually pertinent for you, resolve it.</p>
<p>Feedback is free and only there to help you make a better game. Don't loose time arguing over it to convince people that they should not feel that way.</p>
<h4>When giving feedback, look into the heart of what the game is really about.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bruce Shelley] often saw a glimmer of value in an idea that I was ready to scrap. At the same time, he never got distracted by the parts of the game that weren't finished yet.</p>
<p>I could hand him a broken prototype with terrible graphics, overpowered enemies, and a crash bug three turns in, and he could look right past these immaterial complaints into the heart of what the game was really about.</p>
<p>Where there was potential, he saw potential, and he could isolate areas for subtle improvement without getting distracted by what we both knew was easily fixable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When prototyping or giving feedback to another developer, look right past the details into the heart of what the game is really about. Don't focus on the insignificant bugs/graphical glitches/etc... that you know are just there temporary or will be fixed easily.</p>
<h4>Sit in all the chairs.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] it's important as a designer to sit in all the chairs.
Understanding the needs of each department and learning their requisite tools will improve your output,
ease communication with your coworkers, and provide a critical perspective when it comes time to admit you were wrong about an idea.</p>
<p>But most importantly, it will make you more self-sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already met some people with this versatility. They are experts at what they do, and part of their expertise is due to their knowledge of their colleagues' disciplines.</p>
<p>I studied computer science for 5 years, it's helping me communicating with programmers, but it also alters in a positive way my design process; I am organized and rigorous, I prefer designing game systems more than gameplay or story. And of course, I can create games or prototypes on my own.</p>
<p>I'm sure game designers proficient at visual arts have a lot of drawings everywhere in their documents instead of the ugly and cold squares and circles I use. They have a more visual way of designing things.</p>
<h4>In a team, avoid sharing the same duties.</h4>
<p>Learning teamwork is hard, and making video games is usually a team effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dichotomy between someone else's talent and your own is a cause for celebration, because the further apart you are, the more you can offer each other.
But the opposite is also true. I know where my own talents are, and I find that sharing those duties usually falls somewhere between inefficient or frustrating.</p>
<p>I want to combine other people's unique expertise with mine, and create something that none of us could have made alone -- not compromise on the same task until it's less than the sum of its parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Ubisoft, each game designer is the owner of specific features (For example, I was responsible for the procedural quests on <em>Ghost Recon : Breakpoint</em>). He is the one working on the design, the lead or director will validate his design decisions before starting the production.</p>
<p>The good Game Designers listen to the rest of the team (Artists, Programmers, etc...) to improve the design, but you don't have to compromise with them, you're the only responsible for it, and that makes it more manageable.</p>
<p>Just imagine if the whole 200 people on the team had to agree on everything ?</p>
<p>One of the drawback is that it's harder to link the different game systems together. You're so busy with your feature than you don't know how the development is progressing on the other ones. You can feel a bit on the side, or be in total disagreement with how the other game systems work.</p>
<h3>Sid's Opinions</h3>
<h4>Cheating can be fun.</h4>
<p>Sid really was against cheats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The faster and easier gameplay becomes, the less it starts to count as a game at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the designer in charge of releasing Civ II ignored Sid advice, and shipped the game with a cheat menu available, very easy to find. After seeing his son played with cheats, Sid changed his mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I happened to watch over my son Ryan's shoulder as he gleefully spawned a legion of tanks into the middle ages to squash a few pike men, and I realized that there might be some level of fun behind cheating after all, at least once it becomes sufficiently gratuitous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://fartinvite.com/pics/civilization-2-pc-cheats-2.jpg" alt="civilization-2-pc-cheats-2.jpg"></p>
<p>In my opinion we should <strong>give the opportunity to break or modify the game</strong>, via cheat codes or modding tools. It can be hard to accept that players denatured what you've designed, but a lot of games proved it was very fun to do it. I've started &quot;creating games&quot; with the world map editor of Warcraft 3, it's also on this game that I've enjoyed my first cheat codes.</p>
<p>While modding tools should be available from the start, <strong>cheat codes should be earned</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, after winning the game at least once, playing by the rules. This allows us to be sure the player enjoyed the game as we intended to, while increasing the pleasure of being able to destroy all the rules they respected so far to earn the cheats.</p>
<h4>Micro Transactions are hated but effective.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to ask a group of gamers their opinion on these so-called &quot;micro transactions&quot;, most would probably respond with a string of rude words. But the revenues tell a different story.
[...] We say we hate it, but the balance sheets prove otherwise.</p>
<p>But there's no escaping the fact that many free-to-play games are predatory, especially when they target young children, or blur the line between upgrades and necessary content.
There has to be a worthwhile product underneath, and a respectful, honest relationship with players about what they're getting for their money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate them too. I never buy from these stores, I would be a poor designer on this subject.
Not that I don't like the content they are offering, I just don't want to pay for very optional things that I would prefer to earn by playing.</p>
<p>Of course there are games in which you can gain some decorative things by playing, but it's rarely the sought-after stuff. A counter example is Overwatch, you can unlock almost everything just by playing.</p>
<p>On the other side, I really like DLCs, I think it's normal to pay to have more content unless there was a promise to add more content when you bought the game.</p>
<h4>Suspend reality, not examine the pain of real moral dilemmas.</h4>
<p>Sid gives us his opinion on what he wants to create in his video games, you decide what you want to create in yours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've always felt that our role as game designers is to suspend reality, not examine the pain of real moral dilemmas.
There's a place for that in art, certainly --and videogames do count as art-- but it's generally not a place where people want to spend their time after a long day at the office.</p>
<p>[...] games are expected to sustain their audience far longer than any other art form. [...]
Not many people are willing to wallow in life's toughest moments for that long [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I totally agree with him on the fact that most games should be relaxing, video games have greatly evolved since then, and are not just a relaxation tool anymore. Moreover, some games examine the pain of real moral dilemmas and are still able to make relaxing and fun gameplay. There is an audience for this kind of game nowadays.</p>
<h4>Violence is not necessary.</h4>
<p>As good games should have an impact on the player, he wants to avoid putting too much violence in his games. It can have a negative impact on our players, even mature people that can tell it's fantasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video games are an art form, and it's never a good idea to stifle creativity.
I can say with personal certainty that gamers are mature and intelligent people, and we have the ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
But when it comes to the creations that happen to inspire me, I don't think violence is necessary. The world is often a very negative place, and I'd rather push it in the opposite direction whenever I can.</p>
<p>There's an argument to be made that by exposing the unpleasant reality of violence, you can inspire others to push against it, too, but this generally requires a removed perspective, rather than the inherent first-person nature of games.
It's hard to claim our products are immersive, but somehow insist that the experience has no impact.
<strong>A game with no impact is simply a bad game.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's his opinion. Feel free to disagree and use violence as a tool to impact the player the way you want (thinking about <em>The Last Of Us 2</em> here).</p>
<h4>Compelling games should illuminates our deepest fears about ourselves.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe the thing that makes Civ so compelling is that it illuminates our deepest fears about ourselves.
It's hard to play out a fantasy of worldwide domination without occasionally wondering whether you're really the best person to put in charge after all.</p>
<p>In the right context, a game is not just a vehicle for fun, but an exercise in self-determination and confidence.
Good games teach us that there are trade-offs to everything, actions lead to outcomes, and the chance to try again is almost always out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Connect people through their shared experience.</h4>
<p>An interesting way of seeing our role as artists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gaming is for everyone--and not just on an individual level, but as a whole. It's for everyone together.
I haven't always known what appeals to people who aren't specifically me, but I have always been interested in finding out,
and when it comes to games I thinks addiction is usually just another word for the intense connection we feel toward a work of art.</p>
<p>As an artist, my job is to foster that connection in a constructive way --and if I'm lucky, to connect people to one another through our shared experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Games are not just a diversion.</h4>
<p>The first game of Sid, <em>Hostage Rescue</em>, was made on an Atari in BASIC with the help of magazines. You play as an &quot;Helicopter&quot; trying to save hostages from terrorists. They shoot missiles at you, you shoot missiles at them. But each time you shoot, hostages can die, and the headcount is accusingly displayed at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>His mother tried the game, was very focused, very into the game, avoiding missiles with her own body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But at some point, she dropped the controller and turned the face away. She couldn’t play anymore, her heart was racing and it was too much for her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Games aren’t a diversion. <strong>Games can make people feel</strong>, just like great literature or other form of art, if not more thanks to the interaction that is a core element of games.
I already read several times about this <strong>revelation moment</strong> in several articles and books from other game designers, seems like a common event we all share.</p>
<h4>People are generally uncooperative by nature.</h4>
<p>Not a scientific proof but a good example to consider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CivWorld had a number of problems, the biggest of which was the generally uncooperative nature of real people when put to the test.
[...] for the most part everyone chose to let their friends suffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Funny Anecdoctes</h3>
<h4>The Bingosaur.</h4>
<p>This one's just funny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] I gave up all pretense of realism and invented a dinosaur that could spit poison.
As a friendly nod to our producer at EA, Bing Gordon, I named my new species the Bingosaur.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Gandhi bug is Fake.</h4>
<p>*<em>surprised</em>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it's not the countless callbacks and references that make the nuclear Gandhi story so funny to me. It's the fact that none of it is true. The overflow error never happened at all.
[...] To me, the more interesting question is: What makes this particular story so fascinating that it continues to generate traffic every time it's mentioned?</p>
</blockquote>
