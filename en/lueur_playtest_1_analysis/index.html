    <h1>Lueur's Playtest Analysis</h1>
    <h2>The first playtest for Lueur lasted 10 days with over 40 participants. What can I get from it ?</h2>
    <span class=small-remark>All links to products are affiliated link, you pay the same price and I get a small percentage, thanks for your support!</span>
    <p class=post-date>Posted on December 17, 2022 Â· 15 minutes read</p>
    <div id="content">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I organized my first playtest for Lueur, a minimalist strategy game.
In this post I would like to share the results and how I use them to improve the game, hoping to inspire you for your next playtests. I'm no statistician or expert in data analysis, so I'll keep things simple and intuitive.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about the 46 playtesters who participated :</p>
<ul>
<li>58% of them are game developers.</li>
<li>52% of them usually play strategy/management games.</li>
<li>26% of them know me personally.</li>
<li>22 of them played a &quot;version 1&quot; of the game, 24 played a supposedly improved &quot;version 2&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means :</p>
<ul>
<li>With only 46 testers, I can't extrapolate the results to the whole player base. But I can still make some conclusions about this sample.</li>
<li>My results might be strongly biased (more about this at the end of the article).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closed questions analysis</h3>
<h4>Did you have a good time ? How fun was it to play Lueur ?</h4>
<p>Let's look at the enjoyment and fun. It's basically how much they liked Lueur.</p>
<p>This is a very important question to ask as it will guide me in analyzing the feedback.</p>
<p>People who rated 1/4 do not like the game and it will be hard/impossible to change that. People who rated 2/4 could come to like the game with appropriate changes. People who rated 3/4 liked the game, and could come to really love it with appropriate changes. People who rated 4/4 really loved the the game, I need to be careful not to loose them with inappropriate changes.</p>
<p>That being said, I want to focus my intention on feedback from 2/4 and 3/4 ratings to improve the game.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/fun_version.png" alt="fun by version chart"></p>
<p>Analysis : Seems like the version 2 brought better ratings than version 1</p>
<p>Takeaways : Adding the better difficulty and tutorial improved the experience</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/fun_expertise.png" alt="fun by expertise chart"></p>
<p>Analysis : The expertise does not seem to influence the fun.</p>
<p>Takeaways : On the good track ! I was expecting experts to be bored faster and as such enjoy the game less. As Lueur is aiming for both experts and beginners, that's great. Important to note that I still got frustrations about the game not being complex enough.</p>
<h4>Would you buy the final game for 8$ ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/price_reduced.png" alt="price chart"></p>
<p>Analysis : People could put a custom answer, I regrouped them. A large portion of players are ready to buy the game at this price.</p>
<p>Takeaways : A final price of 7.99$ will be good for 60% of the players. Of course some players are not interested in the game (here 15%) and I can't really do something about that. The remaining will buy the game during promotions which are bound to happen. It's also good to know that expert players have the same distribution. I was afraid more experts would not buy the game or find it too expensive compared to other strategy games.</p>
<h4>Which game mode did you play ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/gamemode.png" alt="game mode chart">
Analysis : Most players played the classic mod. Looking deeper, I discovered that almost all the players who played the other gamemodes were experts. And I noticed in the comments that most of them actually played peaceful after classic, just to try.</p>
<p>Takeaways : No surprises here, the classic mode is the way to go for most people. They are still some people interested in the other game modes. I think more people will play the other game modes after buying the game.</p>
<h4>What do you think of the level duration ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/duration_v1.png" alt="level duration chart v1"></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/duration_v2.png" alt="level duration chart v2"></p>
<p>Analysis : Most people think it's just right or maybe a bit too long or short. A few people think it's way too long in version 1. We can see the version 2 improved the results. The expertise does not change the results.</p>
<p>Takeaways : Lueur needs to be a short game. You don't need to save, and you can quickly play a level for 30 minutes or so and be done with it. I'm happy to see most people are ok with this duration. The skip day button from version 2 might be the key improvement here.</p>
<h4>Would you play again to complete the optional challenges ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/reward.png" alt="replayability chart"></p>
<p>Analysis : 70% of players would play again.</p>
<p>Takeaways : I expected more people to not care about optional challenges. That's good news since I really want the challenges to be part of the game experience.</p>
<h4>Which reward would you prefer ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/favorite_reward.png" alt="reward chart"></p>
<p>Analysis : Achievements and Skins are in front.</p>
<p>Takeaways : Achievements/Card/Emotes are gonna be done anyway, so that's a good thing. Make new skins for some buildings won't be too costly so I'm gonna do it too. I'll pass on harder challenges and new menu background image which were not my favorites in the first place.</p>
<h4>Was the game simple to understand ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/complexity.png" alt="complexity"></p>
<p>Analysis : Most people thing the game is very simple to understand. But a fair amount think it's a bit complex.</p>
<p>Takeaways : The game is very simple, so that's a given most players will find it simple. I think it was still a bit complex for some because of 3 reasons :</p>
<p>- The UI is not the most readable</p>
<p>- The low resolution sprites can be hard to read</p>
<p>- The tutorial is very light</p>
<h4>How much do you like the music ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/music.png" alt="music"></p>
<p>Analysis : The music is very appreciated.</p>
<p>Takeaways : Really surprised by the result considering it's a 40 second loop. I think most the 3/4s come from the lack of diversity. I'll make a longer music loop, but I'll keep the same minimalist sad piano style which seems to be very liked.</p>
<h4>How much do you like the sounds ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/sounds.png" alt="sounds"></p>
<p>Analysis : Sounds are mostly liked but a fair share of people are still neutral about it.</p>
<p>Takeaways : Overall players really liked the idea of having different environment sounds on each tile type. But some of the sounds were too loud, inappropriate or annoying which led to lower ratings.</p>
<h4>How much do you like the graphics ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/graphics.png" alt="graphics"></p>
<p>Analysis : There is a large portion of bad or neutral ratings. Seems like a subjective question.</p>
<p>Takeaways : It's pixel art, not everyone likes pixel art. Moreover, it's very low resolution pixel art, which is even more niche. Knowing this, these are pretty good results, way better than I expected. I'm working on more detailed visuals and I think it's gonna help make the game grasps a bigger audience, especially amateur players.</p>
<h4>How hard is the game ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/difficulty_v1.png" alt="difficulty v1"></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/difficulty_v2.png" alt="difficulty v2"></p>
<p>Analysis : Results are all over the place in version 1. It gets better in version 2, with almost everyone between easy and hard (but not too much).</p>
<p>Takeaways : This is hard to measure since some people will crush the game first try and others will need a few tries to barely win. But It seems like the current difficulty level added in version 2 is very good so far. I'm gonna keep this difficulty and add a secondary objective to complete the level faster for very good players. But I like when the player wins the first game, so I might add dynamic difficulty to help the less skilled players win.</p>
<h4>Did you get bored at some point ?</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/boredom_v1.png" alt="boredom v1"></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/boredom_v2.png" alt="boredom v2"></p>
<p>Analysis : Almost 70% of players got bored during version 1. Version 2 did way better, but still 30% of them got bored at some point.</p>
<p>Takeaways : I'm happy to see that the skip day button/quests/difficulty changes in version 2 really helped. But there are still a lot of people who got bored. I verified and those are people that rated fun 2 or below. I think it comes from the end game and the waves. In the end game, you don't have much more stuff to discover and explore, you mainly just survive. Resisting a wave is not interesting enough too. Tactical choices are kind of limited. I need to add new things to explore in the end game, and to add a new way to fight off darkness as well as new ways for darkness to attack.</p>

<h3>Fun Biases</h3>
<p>Let's review some of the biases and other things that could make this data less reliable. To be honest I just looked at them for fun and I'm not sure it's that useful.</p>
<h4>Are game devs harsher than players ?</h4>
<p>Half of the players are game developers, naturally biased because of their job. They do give more precise feedback. They also tend to analyse the game instead of simply playing it. You need to be careful when reading their feedback as they are more likely to give solutions to problems they analyzed but not necessarily experienced during their session. I had a few feedback telling me &quot;this is really bad for players, you need to remove it&quot; while the &quot;players&quot; actually liked it most of the time.</p>
<p>Because of that, we could think they are harsher than players ?</p>
<p>They are the bulk of 2/4 and 1/4 that's true. But most of them are around 3/4 and 4/4, in equal proportion with the non game devs. We can't really say they are harsher and it seems it might not have biased the test too much.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/fun_players.png" alt="fun gamedev"></p>
<h4>Are my friends too kind ?</h4>
<p>26% of the players were &quot;friends&quot;. By friend I mean any persons that knows me personally and talked with me a few times. Surely it must bias the results ?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/devlogs/playtest_lueur_1/fun_friends.png" alt="fun friends"></p>
<p>A funny thing to observe on this sample is that the closer the friend, the lower the rating. Also, 50% of the 2/4 ratings are from my friends. So, they definitely weren't too kind. Their mean rating is also lower which suggests they were actually a bit harsher.</p>
<h3>Things I should have done in the survey</h3>
<p>Ask :Â 
Which controller did you use ? - Gamepad - Keyboard</p>
<p>What do you think of the controls ? not good 1-5 good</p>
<p>Remove :</p>
<p>&quot;What is missing from the game ? &quot; got similar answers that &quot;something you disliked&quot;</p>
<h3>One important thing I learned</h3>
<p>Some people are convinced that something in your game is completely wrong. But if you find others that are convinced it's not, then you have on your hands a subjective choice. There wonÂ´t be a good answer. You can go with the majority to please more players, or go with your initial idea to stay true to your intentions.</p>
